# Playing with Snap.svg
Just playing around with snap.svg (http://snapsvg.io/). Grabbed some illustrations from https://freepik.com, made some minor changes using Adobe Illustrator and started animating.

My main purpose of dong this is just to understand Vector graphics a bit more.

## ChatBot
The ChatBot animation has ab initial page load animation. Then after that has a infinite loop animation. Below gif is only a sample of the svg animation.
